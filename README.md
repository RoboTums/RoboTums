### Hi there, I'm Tumas ðŸ‘‹

I'm an analyst for Gilder, and write software to help my guide my stock picks. As such, I find myself in the intersection of Data Science, Finance, Software Engineering, and Decision Theory everyday. I used to work in AI research, working in Reinforcement Learning, where I became fascinated by emergence. I'm enamored with the concept of everything working together can create an effect bigger than anything any one of us can do. The US financial system is one of the most complex, and I'm happy to be right in the heart of it.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finding the most exciting stories in tech, especially with public companies. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Pyro](https://pyro.ai/), Uber's Probabilistic Programming Language to model non-linear dynamical systems in finance.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an app to share forecasts with others. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with app development with Flutter/Dart.
