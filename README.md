### Hi there, I'm Tumas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer at Rogo, where I'm helping build the next era of research tools in Finance and Consulting. Used to pick stocks at Gilder. Previously I worked in AI research, working in Reinforcement Learning, where I became fascinated by emergence. I'm fascinated with the concept that smaller things working together can create an effect bigger than anything any one of us can do.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Pyro](https://pyro.ai/), Uber's Probabilistic Programming Language to model non-linear dynamical systems in finance.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an app that generates News, think Buzzfeed AI.
